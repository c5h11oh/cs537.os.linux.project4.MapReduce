A Dialogue on Persistence

Professor: And thus we reach the third of our four ... err... three pillars of
operating systems: persistence.
Student: Did you say there were three pillars, or four? What is the fourth?
Professor: No. Just three, young student, just three. Trying to keep it simple
here.
Student: OK, fine. But what is persistence, oh fine and noble professor?
Professor: Actually, you probably know what it means in the traditional sense,
right? As the dictionary would say: “a firm or obstinate continuance in a course
of action in spite of difficulty or opposition.”
Student: It’s kind of like taking your class: some obstinance required.
Professor: Ha! Yes. But persistence here means something else. Let me explain.
Imagine you are outside, in a field, and you pick a —
Student: (interrupting) I know! A peach! From a peach tree!
Professor: I was going to say apple, from an apple tree. Oh well; we’ll do it your
way, I guess.
Student: (stares blankly)
Professor: Anyhow, you pick a peach; in fact, you pick many many peaches,
but you want to make them last for a long time. Winter is hard and cruel in
Wisconsin, after all. What do you do?
Student: Well, I think there are some different things you can do. You can pickle
it! Or bake a pie. Or make a jam of some kind. Lots of fun!
Professor: Fun? Well, maybe. Certainly, you have to do a lot more work to make
the peach persist. And so it is with information as well; making information
persist, despite computer crashes, disk failures, or power outages is a tough and
interesting challenge.
Student: Nice segue; you’re getting quite good at that.
Professor: Thanks! A professor can always use a few kind words, you know.

A D IALOGUE ON P ERSISTENCE

Student: I’ll try to remember that. I guess it’s time to stop talking peaches, and
start talking computers?
Professor: Yes, it is that time...
